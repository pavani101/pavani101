# Hi there 👋 I'm Pavani Suresh

I am a results-oriented Machine Learning Engineer with a strong focus on data science, statistical modeling, predictive analytics, and scalable machine learning solutions for real-world applications. My work focuses on applying machine learning, computer vision, and deep learning techniques to multimodal datasets in order to build data-driven decision support systems. With over three years of experience, I have developed scalable pipelines, real-time data workflows, and production-ready models using tools such as PyTorch, Docker, and AWS.

During my graduate studies, I specialized in hyperspectral image analysis and semantic segmentation. My research involved creating advanced learning techniques to extract insights from high-dimensional remote sensing data—addressing challenges such as spectral redundancy and limited annotations through both supervised and unsupervised approaches.

Remote sensing, geospatial intelligence, semantic segmentation, and machine learning infrastructure are areas where I bring strong technical expertise. I am also deeply engaged in advancing Explainable AI, contributing to the development of transparent and trustworthy model-driven systems. My focus is on translating innovative research into practical, scalable AI solutions with lasting real-world impact.
